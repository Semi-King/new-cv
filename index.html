        <h2>Hi.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I am a Web Developer from South Africa who is very creatve and loves
          problem solving. I ‚ù§Ô∏è playing video games and coding. I have a passion for
          what I am doing and I will be looking forward to working  with you on
          something in the  near future.

          <h2 class="left" >Programmer & Gamer</h2>
          <p>
            If I am not coding you will probably still find me on my computer
            playing video games competitively. If I was not interested  in programming 
            I would probably be a full time  streamer/content creator because that is something
            dear to my heart and I will never let it go.

          <h2>1v1 me on Apex Legends</h2>
          <p>
            Get the chance to 1v1 me on Apex Legends to see if you can beat me
            or not. I used to play this game for 8 hours+ every single day and  
            I became very good at it and that is why I am competing professionally.
            If you would like to see how good I am just ask me and you will see üòâ
